# Startup and maintenance

## Summary

The robot is accessible via a ZeroTier Virtual Private Network (VPN) which is setup to accommodate one or more robots managed by 
the VPN-manager.  
We setup a ZeroTier-VPN with the robot as a node. The VPN-manager has a mwlc.global account. Please refer to your credentials document.  
The robot can be driven by one operator at a time, not more.

### Preparation
Members of a ZeroTier network are referred to as ‘nodes’. Unless otherwise setup any authorised node can access any other 
authorised node in the same network.

#### ZeroTier client
Install [ZeroTier client](https://www.zerotier.com/download/) on your computer.  
Check your NodeID. This is the ID assigned to your computer. The NodeID will be used in any networks joined.  
Join the network with the ID in the credentials.

#### ZeroTier management
Go to [my.zerotier.com](https://my.zerotier.com).  
Login with the credentials you received from MWLC.  
Go to `Networks`.  
Authorise your computer on the network. You can identify your computer using its NodeID from the preparation step.   
When successful your computer will receive a managed ip.  
Notice the managed ip of the robot in the network. This is the ip to access the robot at.

### Chrome
On your computer, install the Google Chrome browser.  


### Start
Unpack the robot.
Turn the key and wait for several minutes for the startup procedure of the different devices to complete.   
Plug the controller into your computer.
Open chrome and browse to the managed ip of the robot as shown in my.zerotier.com *network* information. 
As an example assume the robot’s managed ip is 192.168.193.42. In the browser’s address bar type:  

    http://192.168.193.42

### Store
1. Place the robot on a platform so that the wheels can turn freely.
1. Plug the charging cable into the charging socket and an internet connection into the WAN-port.
1. For support, it is desirable to place the robot in front of a mirror.

See manual [‘Training Autopilot’](autopilot_manual.md) for further instructions.


## Maintenance

#### Store
When the robot is used the system will try to update software via the cloud. If functionality is changed, a release memo 
and updated manuals will be provided.  
To ensure the updates are possible:  
1. Place the robot on a platform so that the wheels can turn freely.  
1. Plug the charging cable into the charging socket.
1. Plug an internet connection into the WAN-port.


#### Charge
The robot can be charged with a Victron Blue smart 24v/5A charger. 
See [www.victronenergy.com/chargers/blue-smart-ip65-charger](https://www.victronenergy.com/chargers/blue-smart-ip65-charger). 
The charger comes with an app with all relevant information.  
At the back of the robot you will find a magnetic Rosenberger connector. The charge connector fits in one orientation only.


#### Clean
It's important to keep the transparent casing of the camera’s clean.  
For maintenance of the chassis please follow the guidelines of Arrma.

## Troubleshooting

The robot is built with broadly general available parts. You can assemble it yourself but some companies prefer an 
[assembled version](mwlc_order.md). 
For more information contact MWLC for a parts list and [assembly instructions](mwlc_kit.md).

#### Main engine does not start but all lights are on.
Please check the fuse for the chassis.

#### Main engine does not stop after hitting the red button.
This is dangerous, don't use the robot. Contact us.

### Connection issues
See manual [‘Connections and ZeroTier’](zerotier_manual.md).
