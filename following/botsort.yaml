# âœ…tracker_type: botsort: Tracker type, with options ['botsort', 'bytetrack']. Choose between BoT-SORT or ByteTrack for object tracking.
# âœ…track_high_thresh: 0.5: Threshold for the first association. It determines the confidence level for the initial track association.
# âœ…track_low_thresh: 0.1: Threshold for the second association. This threshold is used for refining track associations.
# âœ…new_track_thresh: 0.6: Threshold for initializing a new track if the detection doesn't match any existing tracks. This parameter influences the creation of new object tracks.
# âœ…track_buffer: 30: Buffer to calculate the time when to remove tracks. It helps manage the retention period for tracks in the tracking system.
# âœ…match_thresh: This parameter determines the level of similarity required for associating detections with existing tracks.
# âœ…gmc_method:I is used for tracking in scenarios with camera movement or background motion
# âœ…proximity_thresh: 0.5: Threshold for proximity. It plays a role in determining the closeness criteria for objects or tracks.
# âœ…appearance_thresh: 0.25: Threshold for appearance. This parameter relates to the confidence level in matching the appearance features of objects during tracking.
# âœ…with_reid: False: Indicates whether ReID (Re-identification) is enabled (currently set to False). ReID is a technique used for identifying and distinguishing objects across different frames.
